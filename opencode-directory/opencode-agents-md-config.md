# OpenCode AGENTS.md Configuration

**Link:** https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/1490

**Summary:** AGENTS.md files are configuration files used to define custom agent instructions and behaviors in OpenCode. Key aspects include:

- Global configuration at `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
- Project-specific agent instructions
- Dynamic system prompts for custom agents
- Memory bank configurations for specific libraries
- Custom tool definitions and workflows
- Agent behavior customization

The AGENTS.md system allows users to create specialized agents with specific instructions, similar to Claude Code's setup, enabling tailored AI assistance for different programming contexts and project requirements.
