Update action description or status in the roadmap. Can ONLY modify actions, never features. Allowed changes: action status (pending → in_progress → completed) and action description (full overwrite). Cannot add actions, modify features, or change numbers.

Rules:
- Only actions can be modified, features are immutable after creation
- Action numbers cannot be changed
- Status must follow progression: pending → in_progress → completed
- Description changes completely overwrite existing description
- Must specify action number (e.g., "1.01", "1.02", "2.01")

Valid Status Transitions:
- "pending" → "in_progress" or "completed"
- "in_progress" → "completed"
- "completed" → (no changes allowed)

Examples:
- Update status only: {"actionNumber": "1.01", "status": "in_progress"}
- Update description only: {"actionNumber": "1.01", "description": "New description", "status": "pending"}
- Update both: {"actionNumber": "1.01", "description": "Updated task", "status": "completed"}

Use ReadRoadmap first to see current action numbers and statuses if unsure.
