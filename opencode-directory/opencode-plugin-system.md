# OpenCode Plugin System

**Link:** https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/

**Summary:** OpenCode's plugin system allows developers to extend functionality by hooking into various events and customizing behavior. Key aspects include:

- Event-driven architecture with before/after tool call hooks
- JavaScript/TypeScript plugin support
- Custom tool creation capabilities
- Integration with external services
- Workflow automation possibilities
- Community-contributed plugins

Plugins can intercept events, modify behavior, add new features, and integrate with third-party services, making OpenCode highly extensible for specific development workflows.
