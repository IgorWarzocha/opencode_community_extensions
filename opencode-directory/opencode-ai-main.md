**Summary:** OpenCode is an open-source AI coding agent built specifically for the terminal. It's a Go-based CLI application that provides a responsive, native, themeable Terminal User Interface (TUI) for AI-assisted coding. Key features include:

- Native TUI experience for terminal-based developers
- Support for 75+ AI models including Claude, OpenAI, and local models
- Multi-session functionality
- Complete open-source with no vendor lock-in
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Non-interactive mode for scripting and automation
- Client/server architecture allowing remote control

OpenCode is designed for developers who prefer command-line speed and efficiency, bringing the power of large language models directly into the terminal environment.
